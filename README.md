Leonardo is a tool that combines steganography, symmetric encryption, and additional AI protection to securely encrypt and embed strings into images.

## > Features


- **New:** Encrypt a string into an already existing image using Stegodon (a C# library built for this project) and high-bit AES encryption.

- **Crack:** Decrypt any message that was injected through this app.

- **Gen:** Insert Stable Diffusion prompt, insert the string you want to encrypt, and save your one-of-a-kind password holder.

## > Known Issues

- **Gen HTTP Request:** Gen utilizes an HTTP request to fetch from an API, which can fail when loading the service initially. Restart the application a few times until you establish a connection. We are actively working on fixing this in the next patch series.
