## Features

> **New:** Encrypt a string into an already existing image using Stegodon (a C# library built for this project) and high-bit AES encryption.

> **Crack:** Decrypt any message that was injected through this app.

> **Gen:** Insert Stable Diffusion prompt, insert the string you want to encrypt, and save your one-of-a-kind password holder.

## Known Issues

IF YOU RECEIVE THE *BAD REQUEST* ERROR YOU ARE USING AN OUTDATED VERSION OF THE PROGRAM. Download the latest build to fix this issue [here](https://github.com/2alf/Leonardo/releases/latest)
This error is made because HF had a token breach and a lot of existing tokens were deleted. This new version has a new token.

> **Gen HTTP Request:** Gen utilizes an HTTP request to fetch from an API, which can fail when loading the service initially. Restart the application a few times until you establish a connection. We are actively working on fixing this in the next patch series.

>After its done you will get the following popup when your image has been generated. 

>If there are issues with this part restart your application and check the [known issues](#known-issues) tab.

### Standard encryption


>To simply encrypy an password into an already existing image using our algorithm and encryption follow the steps below.
